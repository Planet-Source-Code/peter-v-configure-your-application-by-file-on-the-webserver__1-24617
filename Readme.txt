With this application i want to show you that you can control the behavior
of an application by Remote.(HTTP get file)
Changing captions, data , showing/hiding box's, enabling box's.. ect..
The possibility is huge!
This application use's the Inet ocx (standard in VB).

How it works..
--------------

Start up the program.
Now you see a screen with 2 options buttons .. 1 for local file & 1 for
remote file.

if you want first to use, test the local file..
the you have to copy the Login.txt (in the zipped file) to you HD.
Press then on the 'OK' button.
Now you can see the mainForm , with Listbox , textbox , Checkbox..ect..
And you can also see the loaded data from the file..
This applications behavior is changed by the file..


If you want to use it by Remote,(option button 'Program controlled by internet')
Put the wanted file on your homepage..
Press on 'ok'
Now the application goes to your url , get the data in the file by HTTP get.
And test it now...

PS : 
if you don't change the Startup data in URL & Filename (Remotely)
then it goes to my site get the data there..

On my Site is an example of the a file..
